There are four options for running Node.js applications on Google Cloud Platform:

- Google Compute Engine

- Google Container Engine

- Google App Engine flexible environment

- Google Cloud Functions

## Node.js on Compute Engine

Hosting a Node.js application on [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) is just like hosting a Node.js application on a traditional Virtual Private Server (VPS)â€”you have complete control of the virtual machine. Google Compute Engine delivers virtual machines running in Google's innovative data centers and worldwide fiber network. Compute Engine's tooling and workflow support enable scaling from single instances to global, load-balanced cloud computing.

## Node.js on Container Engine

[Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/) is a powerful cluster manager and orchestration system for running your Docker containers. Container Engine schedules your containers into the cluster and manages them automatically based on requirements you define (such as CPU and memory). It's built on the open source Kubernetes system, giving you the flexibility to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure. With it you can orchestrate containerized Node.js deployments using Kubernetes' container management infrastructure.

## Node.js on App Engine flexible environment

[App Engine flexible environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/) is a fully managed, Docker-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). You can deploy, monitor, and scale Node.js applications without having to know anything about virtual machines, containers, or compute infrastructure. Google manages your Node.js application for you.

## Node.js on Cloud Functions

[Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose functions that respond to cloud events without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment. You deploy individual functions written in Node.js that are executed in response to various cloud events, including direct HTTP requests.
